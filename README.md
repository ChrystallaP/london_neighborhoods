# london_neighborhoods

As part of the capstone project for the Data Science specialization offered by Coursera, I used the Foursquare API to get venues data for London, scraped Wikipedia to get data for the neighoborhoods of London, and geopy library to gather information about the latitute and longitude of each neighborhood. The aim of the project was to segment and cluster the neighborhoods of London and find the best neighborhoods for opening new restaurants.
